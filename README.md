# Cplusplus-Program

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project that I have selected to showcase is the final project that we did for CS-210. In this project, we are given a printed list of the items that were bought at a grocery store. We take this file and iterate through it to get a calculation of how many of what items were bought to help profile the layout of the store.

### What did you do particularly well?
  What I did particularly well was the taking of the list, passing it off to Python to iterate through the list then print that list in decending order. To me, this makes the list easier to read.
  
### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Things that I could do to enhance my code would to possible work on the input validation and error checking. Also, I would improve on the formatting of the printed list.
  
### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The piece of code that I found the most challenging to write was the error/input validation of the user input. Also, I had a little difficulty creating the Python code. I referenced back to old text books to help in those areas.
  
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills that I believe will be the most transferable would be the error checking and the structures of the work.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The code is split up into a class structure with functions that will enchance its ability to be expanded on and maintained. I used comments throughout to help the readability of the code, so that it can be understood what the code is doing.
